# Getting Started with Git and GitHub

## Step 1: Install Git

Before you can use Git, you need to install it on your computer.

Windows:
- Download the Git installer from git-scm.com.
- Run the installer and follow the instructions. Use the default settings unless you have specific requirements.

Mac: 
- Install Git using Homebrew. Open Terminal and run:
```sh
brew install git
```

Linux:
- Install Git using the package manager of your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```
- To verify the installation, open your terminal and run:
```sh
git --version
```
- You should see the installed Git version.
  
## Step 2: Set Up Git

Set up your Git configuration with your name and email address. This information will be associated with your commits.
  ```sh
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

## Step 3: Create a New Repository

A repository (or repo) is where your project is stored.

Navigate to your project directory:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
Initialize a new Git repository:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
This command creates a new subdirectory named `.git` that contains all of your necessary repository files.

## Step 4: Stage and Commit Changes

Stage your files:

  ```sh
  git add .
  ```
This command stages all the files in your project. You can stage individual files by specifying the file name instead of `.`.

Commit your changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
The `-m` flag allows you to include a commit message.

## Step 5: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
2. Click on the “New” button or the “+” icon and select “New repository”.
3. Fill out the repository details:
 - Repository name: Choose a name for your repository.
 - Description: Add a description for your repository (optional).
 - Public/Private: Choose whether your repository should be public or private.
 - Initialize with a README: You can choose to add a README file.
4. Click "Create repository".

## Step 6: Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```
Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin master
   ```
The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch, so in the future, you can simply use `git push` to push changes.

## Step 7: Make Changes and Push Updates

Make changes to your project files.

Stage and commit your changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```
Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push
   ```

## Step 8: Pull Changes from GitHub

If you are working in a team, you might want to pull the latest changes from the remote repository.
   ```sh
   git pull origin master
   ```

## Step 9: Branching and Merging

Create a new branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b new-branch-name
   ```

Switch to the branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout new-branch-name
   ```

After making changes, commit them and switch back to the master branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout master
   ```

Merge the new branch into the master branch:
   ```sh
   git merge new-branch-name
   ```

## Step 10: Deleting a Branch

Once you're done with a branch, you can delete it:
   ```sh
   git branch -d new-branch-name
   ```

Congratulations! You've learned the basics of using Git and GitHub. This tutorial covered installation, setup, creating a repository, making commits, pushing changes, and basic branching and merging. By mastering these fundamentals, you're well on your way to efficient version control and collaboration with Git and GitHub.
